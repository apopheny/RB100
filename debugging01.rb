# Reading Error Messages

# You come across the following code. What errors does it raise for the given examples and what exactly do the error messages mean?

def find_first_nonzero_among(numbers)
  numbers.each do |n|
    return n if n.nonzero?
  end
end

# Examples

# find_first_nonzero_among(0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0)
find_first_nonzero_among(1)

# the first example raises a number of arguments error, as the method as defined expects one argument and the example passes six

# the second raises a no method error as the method each is not available for the integer class

# the each method is used to evaluate arrays, which contain multiple index:value pairs, but are one item

Solution

This method is expecting an array of integers to be passed in as the argument. The example method invocations should look like this:

find_first_nonzero_among([0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0])
find_first_nonzero_among([1])

Discussion

The first method invocation (line 9) raises an ArgumentError on line 1:

example.rb:1:in `find_first_nonzero_among': wrong number of arguments (given 6, expected 1) (ArgumentError)

The error message tells you that the method find_first_nonzero_among was given 6 arguments but expects only 1 (specified by the parameter numbers).

The second method invocation (line 10) receives the correct number of arguments, so no error is raised on line 1. However, as soon as the program tries to evaluate line 2 with the given argument, it raises a NoMethodError:

example.rb:2:in `find_first_nonzero_among': undefined method `each' for 1:Integer (NoMethodError)

This is because the method parameter numbers is now bound to the provided argument 1, so it tries to evaluate 1.each do ... end, i.e. it tries to call each on the Integer 1. Since integers do not have an each method, this raises a NoMethodError.
