}

car[:year] = 2003

Discussion

Modifying hash values is at the core of working with the hash data structure. With Hash#[]= it's possible to modify the value associated with an existing key or add a new key-value pair altogether. In our solution, we place the name of the desired key inside the brackets, like this: [:year]. This means we're selecting the key :year if it exists. If it doesn't exist, however, we need to provide a value, like 2003, so that it will be created.

After adding the new key-value pair, car should look like this:

car = {
  type:    'sedan',
  color:   'blue',
  mileage: 80_000,
  year:    2003
}
