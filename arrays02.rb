# More Than One

# In the code below, an array containing different types of pets is assigned to pets.

pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

# Write some code that selects 'fish' and 'lizard' from the pets array - select the two items at the same time. Assign the return value to a variable named my_pets, then print the contents of my_pets as a single string, e.g.:

my_pets = pets[2, 3]

puts "I have a pet #{my_pets[0]} and a pet #{my_pets[1]}!"

# I have a pet fish and a pet lizard!

# Make sure you use my_pets to get the words "fish" and "lizard" in that message.

Solution

my_pets = pets[2..3]

puts "I have a pet #{my_pets[0]} and a pet #{my_pets[1]}!"

Discussion

Selecting a specific element from an array is fairly simple. But what about selecting more than one element at the same time? Think about how counting numbers works for a moment. Typically, you'll count from the lowest number to the highest. What about counting only certain numbers like 1 through 5?

In Ruby, this is called a range of numbers. 1..5 is the same as 1 through 5. We can apply this concept to select multiple elements from an array. Instead of just using a single number, pets[2], we can use a range of numbers to select both 'fish' and 'lizard', like this pets[2..3]. Note that when you print my_pets, you'll need to use [0] and [1] because it will be in the form of an array, not a string.
