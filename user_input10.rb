# Opposites Attract

# Write a program that requests two integers from the user, adds them together, and then displays the result. Furthermore, insist that one of the integers be positive, and one negative; however, the order in which the two integers are entered does not matter.

# Do not check for the positive/negative requirement until both integers are entered, and start over if the requirement is not met.

# You may use the following method to validate input integers:

def valid_number?(number_string)
  number_string.to_i.to_s == number_string && number_string.to_i != 0
end

loop do
  puts ">> Please enter a positive or negative integer:"
  number_one = gets.chomp.to_s
  if valid_number?(number_one) == false
    puts "Invalid input. Only non-zero integers are allowed."
    next
  end
  puts ">> Please enter a positive or negative integer:"
  number_two = gets.chomp.to_s
  if valid_number?(number_two) == false
    puts "Invalid input. Only non-zero integers are allowed."
    next
  end
integer_one = number_one.to_i
integer_two = number_two.to_i
  if integer_one.positive? == true && integer_two.positive? == true
    puts "Sorry. One integer must be positive, one must be negative."
    puts "Please start over."
    next
  elsif integer_one.negative? == true && integer_two.negative? == true
    puts "Sorry. One integer must be positive, one must be negative."
    puts "Please start over."
    next
  else
    puts "#{integer_one} + #{integer_two} = #{integer_one + integer_two}"
    break
  end
end

# Examples:

# $ ruby opposites.rb
# >> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
# 8
# >> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
# 0
# >> Invalid input. Only non-zero integers are allowed.
# >> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
# -5
# 8 + -5 = 3

# $ ruby opposites.rb
# >> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
# 8
# >> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
# 5
# >> Sorry. One integer must be positive, one must be negative.
# >> Please start over.
# >> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
# -7
# >> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
# 5
# -7 + 5 = -2

Approach/Algorithm

You can use a nested loop (a loop inside a loop) to solve this problem, but it may be easier to use a method to obtain both input integers.
Solution

def valid_number?(number_string)
  number_string.to_i.to_s == number_string && number_string.to_i != 0
end

def read_number
  loop do
    puts '>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:'
    number = gets.chomp
    return number.to_i if valid_number?(number)
    puts '>> Invalid input. Only non-zero integers are allowed.'
  end
end

first_number = nil
second_number = nil

loop do
  first_number = read_number
  second_number = read_number
  break if first_number * second_number < 0
  puts '>> Sorry. One integer must be positive, one must be negative.'
  puts '>> Please start over.'
end

sum = first_number + second_number
puts "#{first_number} + #{second_number} = #{sum}"

Discussion

In this exercise we demonstrate how to handle multiple inputs that must be validated both independently and together; this is done by using a loop inside another loop (nested loops), but it is often easier to simply refactor the input loop into a separate method (or multiple methods if needed). We take this approach with our solution.

Of course, we use the provided valid_number? method for validation. This differs from the valid_number? we used previously in that it also treats 0 as an invalid entry.

Next, we have a read_number method that we use for our standard get-some-input pattern. The main difference here is that we return from the method instead of using break to exit the loop. (You can also use break number.to_i, but since we really want to return instead, we use return.)

We then initialize our two input variables, then start a loop that reads each of the 2 numbers, then exits if their product is negative, or issues an error message and repeats the loop if the product is positive. Note that the product is negative if and only if one number is positive, the other negative, so this satisfies our requirement that one number be positive, the other negative.

Finally, we add the two numbers together and print the result.
