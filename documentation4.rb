# Return Value of break

# In the previous exercise, you learned that the while loop returns nil unless break is used. Locate the documentation for break, and determine what value break sets the return value to for the while loop.

# It returns the value that satisfied the break condition, or nil if no such exists.

Solution

break returns nil when no arguments are passed to break, or the value of the argument when an argument is provided.
Discussion

Documentation for break is on the "control expressions" page. It tells you that break returns the value of the argument when given an argument. However, it doesn't explicitly say what happens when you don't.

You have to read between the lines here; the while loop documentation says that while returns nil unless break receives a value. So, if break is not supplied a value, while still returns nil.

Another way of figuring out that break returns nil when not given an argument comes from knowing that all statements in Ruby return a value -- usually nil unless the documentation says otherwise. Since no other return value makes sense for break, nil is the most likely value. However, this requires a bit of looking into the mind of the designer.

You can also write and run a simple program, either in irb or as a program file, to see what the return value is:

result = while true
  break
end
p result

That is, perhaps, the best way to determine the return value.
