# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?
 
# exception handling instructs a ruby program on what to do when an error is generated, preserving the return up to that point and allowing you to, say, log the error

Exception handling is a structure used to handle the possibility of an error occurring in a program. It is a way of handling the error by changing the flow of control without exiting the program entirely.
