# More flavors competing. Add some more flavors to the ULTIMATE FLAVOR TOURNAMENT. Was it difficult to do? What changes would you need to make so that itâ€™s easy to add new flavors to the tournament?

# it was a pain in the ass and i had to repeat the while loop to account for the shorter array in match three.

# changes would probably include changing the puts to something referring to the stated index by position by reading the array rather than manually, perhaps as a nested method.
