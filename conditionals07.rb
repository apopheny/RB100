Discussion

We've written an if statement before, but it's good to see how it compares to a case statement. They're very similar in structure, however, for this example, the case statement would be more appropriate.

As stated in the previous exercise, the case statement is best suited for comparing multiple values to the same case. If you look at the if statement, you can see that we compare stoplight to a different value a total of three times. It would be much simpler to reference stoplight once, then list the comparisons. That's where case really shines.
