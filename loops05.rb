# Print While

# Using a while loop, print 5 random numbers between 0 and 99. The code below shows an example of how to begin solving this exercise.

numbers = (1..99).to_a
count = 0

while count != 5
  puts numbers.sample
  count += 1
end

# Example output (your numbers will most likely be different):

# 62
# 96
# 31
# 16
# 36

Approach/Algorithm

The method Kernel#rand does a nice job of returning a random number.
Solution

numbers = []

while numbers.size < 5
  numbers << rand(100)
end

puts numbers

Discussion

Implementing a while loop that iterates under set conditions should be fairly trivial. The more difficult part of this exercise is, perhaps, getting random numbers and keeping track of them. To accomplish this, we use #rand. This method works well because it returns a random number between 0 and one less than the number provided. In this case, that number is 100.

Once the random number is returned, we want to avoid printing it immediately. If we simply printed the returned number, while would iterate infinitely. Instead, we want to add the returned number to an array. This way, we can tell whileto stop iterating after 5 numbers have been added to the array.
