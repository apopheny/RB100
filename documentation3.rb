#Using the ruby documentation, determine what value a while loop returns.

# https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/doc/syntax/control_expressions_rdoc.html

# The result of a while loop is nil unless break is used to supply a value.
=begin

Solution

nil unless break is used, in which case the value passed to break is used.
Discussion

The while loop documentation is on the "control expressions" page. This documentation tells you how the return value is arrived at.
=end
